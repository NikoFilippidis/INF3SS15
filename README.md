## C-Sharp Mathematical operation parser 
This parser can detect weather an expression is mathematically correct and can be calculated or not. 
The following EBNF which is matching mathematical snytax rules and implemented.


*Expression = Number | Operator | '(' Expression Operator Expression ')'*

*Operator   = '+' | '-' | ''*' | '/'

*Number 	   = '1' | '2' | '3' | '4' | '5' | '6' | '7' | '8'| '9'* 


Use as input is a list of possible expressions the program gives a boolean response.

## Java & Python Producer-Consumer-Problem
Both programs take any type of numbers as input. 
Producers and consumers are created in threads which are later joined together to avoid problems such as Dirty-Read or Lost-Update.

## Eiffel Binary Tree 
This binary tree can insert elements, check if a specific element is existing and delete elements recursive.

## C++ Filter using Lamda Expressions
This program generates random strings and filters the strings for words and float numbers.
